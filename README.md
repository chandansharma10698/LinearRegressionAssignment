# Linear Regression Model Building: Boom Bikes Data

## Introduction
This notebook demonstrates the process of building a linear regression model using the Boom Bikes data. The aim is to predict bike-sharing demand based on various features using a linear regression approach. This analysis is based on the Upgard Bike Sharing Assignment using day.csv file.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Boom Bikes dataset, which contains information about bike-sharing services. The dataset includes various features such as weather conditions, demand, and time-based factors.

### Features:
- **Date**: The date of the bike rental.
- **Hour**: The hour of the day.
- **Temperature**: The temperature at the time of rental.
- **Humidity**: The humidity level at the time of rental.
- **Windspeed**: The wind speed at the time of rental.
- **Season**: The season during which the bike was rented.
- **Weather**: The weather conditions at the time of rental.
- **Count**: The number of bikes rented.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this notebook are:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset and the relationships between features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Model Building**: Build a linear regression model to predict bike-sharing demand.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Exploration
   - **Loading Data**: Import the dataset and explore its structure.
   - **Visualizations**: Create plots to visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Address any missing values in the dataset.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create or modify features to improve the model.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for the model.

### 3. Model Building
   - **Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - **Training the Model**: Fit a linear regression model to the training data.
   - **Predicting**: Use the model to make predictions on the testing data.

### 4. Model Evaluation
   - **Metrics**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - **Residual Analysis**: Analyze the residuals to assess the model's performance and identify any patterns.

## Key Findings
- **Model Performance**: The linear regression model's performance metrics are discussed, providing insights into how well the model predicts bike-sharing demand.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of which features have the most significant impact on the predictions.

## Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings, insights gained from the analysis, and potential next steps for improving the model or extending the analysis.
